# Creating A Model  
The first step in crafting your own dildo is to create a positive primary model of the toy. This will be used to define the shape of a production silicone glove mold. The main method discussed here will be to design the toy digitally and then 3d print a primary model for sculpting. Other options include hand-sculpting a model with clay, wax, sculpey, or similar.
  
One thing I want to emphasize is that the silicone mold-making process produces *exact* replicas of whatever the shape of the primary model is. Any surface aberration, no matter how small, will be reproduced in the finished toy. 
  
## Design Constraints
  
### Flat Base
This guide is written assuming the toy will have a flat, reasonably stable base. The toy is poured with the tip down, so the level top surface of the poured liquid silicone creates a flat base plane.  
  
I also strongly recommend that all toys be designed with a flared base, to reduce risk of anything getting lost internally.
  
### Undercut  
An undercut is any feature that prevents the toy being removed from the mold. With the single-piece glove mold technique described in this document, this is generally any feature where a toy is widens in the direction of the tip. Since the glove mold is flexible there is some tolerance for small amounts of undercut like bumps and ridges, but extreme undercuts such as a buttplug shape would require use of a two-part block mold.
  
### Bubble Traps  
The toy will be poured with the mold tip-down. As you pour, the level of silicone in the mold will rise evenly, starting from the lowest point in the mold. Design your model so that there are no pockets where escaping air or rising bubbles to become trapped, or else the finished toy will be plagued by bubble pores. 

## 3D Modeling a Toy  
A full overview of 3D sculpting and modeling methods is far beyond the scope of this document. 

Use whatever software is most comfortable for you.   
  
Blender is a free modeling program that is extremely comprehensive, though its user interface is a lot more clunky than other offerings. More professional-oriented digital sculpting tools include ZBrush and Mudbox, though getting a legitimate license can be exceedingly expensive. Going another route, you can also use CAD software ranging from something as bare-bones as OpenSCAD to something as complex as Autodesk.
    
Any program capable of creating an ``.stl` file for 3d printing will work. If you get started using software that you're not familiar with -- especially free software -- make sure it can export to `.stl` before you invest too much time in making a model.  
  
It may be extremely helpful to create a rough sketch or physical approximation of a toy before starting on a digital sculpt, to provide reference for the desired dimension and proportions. 
  
## Print 
3D print your toy.  
  
The post-processing instructions provided in this document apply mostly to filament printers.  
  
The print material is noncritical. I've done it with PLA, but see no reason why ABS or other materials wouldn't work.
  
The finer the layer height, the less surface finish post-processing you'll need to do. Similarly, areas needing support material will require additional post-processing (though, note, designing to avoid undercut should already minimize the need for supports).   
  
Depending on the way your modeling program is set up, it may take multiple iterations to get a correct scale factor for printing.
